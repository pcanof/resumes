**Week 2 Polyglot Programming**

What I have learned from the videos is that great programmers actually trust other programmers to carry out the project that made them famous and you have to know how to socialize with your co-workers so that by working together we can create code that works efficiently. Working in a team requires having a friendly environment to be able to communicate and understand each other, and I also learned that performance is important in web applications and the data compression is a good way to achieve this.

As in other readings or videos, I understood that perfection is unreal and extremely complex, so it is recommended that you need to be agile. And for someone who wants to be agile, all it takes is effort, strategy, and hard work. And I see how to use scripts in a Linux terminal and these is very usefu when you want to run a program in your PC that manages the files on the PC or some of its resources. For this I need to find out more about the scripts, it seems very intersting.

**Exercise**

With the google jam exercise, I learn how to use clojure that is a program language that I never hear about it. I learn how to install clojure in the terminal of the mac and then how to run a line of the code in the terminal. Also I learn about queues and stack from an exercise from HackerRank, I already know about these data structures but I donâ€™t use them a lot so is good remember about this.
