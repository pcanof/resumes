#Week 1 - Innovation & hard / smart work

Readings and videos

In this week I learned about how to start a business from an idea, but only with the idea is not enough to have a successful business, it is necessary to have a good execution of the idea so that it can become a successful project. In the beginning of the project should be simple because wanting to do a very efficient and fast project makes the project very complicated but if you do a simple project and it works correctly, the client will happy for the results and then you can start looking for a way to improve it if the project need it.

Another thing I saw was about using a terminal shell, which is something I am very familiar. It's about permissions and some commands to create, modify or delete files, but it was useful to get some feedback on the subject.

pwd - Show current working directory

cd - Change current working directory

cd .. - Go back to the previous folder

ls - Show all files in the working directory

mv - Move a file

cp - Copy a file

mkdir - Make a directory

Meetings

The meetings of this week I learned in the orientation meeting about who to turn to in case of problems and the departments are in the channels of the messaging platform. Another thing I learned was about the security of my home network where it is advisable to have the firewall of the modem or router active to avoid any security problem. I also learned about my coworkers how they organize themselves to carry out the tasks of their projects and some recreative meetings. Something that stuck in my memory was a meeting about how to break the ice with another person and that it is important for work to have good communication with your coworkers.
