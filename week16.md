**Second week in Phase 4**
**In my week number 16 in encora**


For this week I learn more about interviews and how to make a resume or CV. In this week I was preparing for some activitie called interviewmania where someone will ask me questions about some computer science topics and also some questions about the stack that I have with some programming lenguages and for that a I learned that is better to be in calm when you are in a interview this helps to  answer the question with more confidence.



For my interview for this activity, I have some feedback I need to study more about heaps, hastables, design patterns and mocks. But for the interviewer had some feedback too, some of them was that at the beginnig of the interview it wasnt a context and the interviewer didnt help with some tips for the interviewee. This will help me to do a better interview when my turn to be the interviewer come out.
