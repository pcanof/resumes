**Last week for the project build something from scratch**
In this week I learened about how to merge my branch of the repository with the main brach and how to fix some of the issues when you try to merge files that have a conflict change. I also learned about how to document a javascript api with swager and how to edit a readme file to explain the purpose of the project and how to use the designed program. In the final demo we receive feedback about all the process of the project and they congratulated our team work but they don't like that we don't listen to their comments and they don't feel part of the project, so we need improve the conversation with the client.
