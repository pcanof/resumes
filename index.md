 
#Week 1 - Innovation & hard / smart work

Readings and videos

In this week I learned about how to start a business from an idea, but only with the idea is not enough to have a successful business, it is necessary to have a good execution of the idea so that it can become a successful project. In the beginning of the project should be simple because wanting to do a very efficient and fast project makes the project very complicated but if you do a simple project and it works correctly, the client will happy for the results and then you can start looking for a way to improve it if the project need it.

Another thing I saw was about using a terminal shell, which is something I am very familiar. It's about permissions and some commands to create, modify or delete files, but it was useful to get some feedback on the subject.

pwd - Show current working directory

cd - Change current working directory

cd .. - Go back to the previous folder

ls - Show all files in the working directory

mv - Move a file

cp - Copy a file

mkdir - Make a directory
 
Meetings

The meetings of this week I learned in the orientation meeting about who to turn to in case of problems and the departments are in the channels of the messaging platform. Another thing I learned was about the security of my home network where it is advisable to have the firewall of the modem or router active to avoid any security problem. I also learned about my coworkers how they organize themselves to carry out the tasks of their projects and some recreative meetings. Something that stuck in my memory was a meeting about how to break the ice with another person and that it is important for work to have good communication with your coworkers.





#Week 2 Polyglot Programming 

What I have learned from the videos is that great programmers actually trust other programmers to carry out the project that made them famous and you have to know how to socialize with your co-workers so that by working together we can create code that works efficiently. Working in a team requires having a friendly environment to be able to communicate and understand each other, and I also learned that performance is important in web applications and the data compression is a good way to achieve this. 

  

As in other readings or videos, I understood that perfection is unreal and extremely complex, so it is recommended that you need to be agile. And for someone who wants to be agile, all it takes is effort, strategy, and hard work. And I see how to use scripts in a Linux terminal and these is very usefu when you want to run a program in your PC that manages the files on the PC or some of its resources. For this I need to find out more about the scripts, it seems very intersting.

 

Exercise 

With the google jam exercise, I learn how to use clojure that is a program language that I never hear about it.  I learn how to install clojure in the terminal of the mac and then how to run a line of the code in the terminal. Also I learn about queues and stack from an exercise from HackerRank, I already know about these data structures but I donâ€™t use them a lot so is good remember about this.
