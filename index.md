#Week 1 - Innovation & hard / smart work

 Readings and videos

 In this week I learned about how to start a business from an idea, but only with the idea is not enough to have a successful business, it is necessary to have a good execution of the idea so that it can become a successful project. In the beginning of the project should be simple because wanting to do a very efficient and fast project makes the project very complicated but if you do a simple project and it works correctly, the client will happy for the results and then you can start looking for a way to improve it if the project need it.

 Another thing I saw was about using a terminal shell, which is something I am very familiar. It's about permissions and some commands to create, modify or delete files, but it was useful to get some feedback on the subject.

 pwd - Show current working directory

 cd - Change current working directory

 cd .. - Go back to the previous folder

 ls - Show all files in the working directory

 mv - Move a file

 cp - Copy a file

 mkdir - Make a directory

 Meetings

 The meetings of this week I learned in the orientation meeting about who to turn to in case of problems and the departments are in the channels of the messaging platform. Another thing I learned was about the security of my home network where it is advisable to have the firewall of the modem or router active to avoid any security problem. I also learned about my coworkers how they organize themselves to carry out the tasks of their projects and some recreative meetings. Something that stuck in my memory was a meeting about how to break the ice with another person and that it is important for work to have good communication with your coworkers.





 #Week 2 Polyglot Programming 

 What I have learned from the videos is that great programmers actually trust other programmers to carry out the project that made them famous and you have to know how to socialize with your co-workers so that by working together we can create code that works efficiently. Working in a team requires having a friendly environment to be able to communicate and understand each other, and I also learned that performance is important in web applications and the data compression is a good way to achieve this. 



 As in other readings or videos, I understood that perfection is unreal and extremely complex, so it is recommended that you need to be agile. And for someone who wants to be agile, all it takes is effort, strategy, and hard work. And I see how to use scripts in a Linux terminal and these is very usefu when you want to run a program in your PC that manages the files on the PC or some of its resources. For this I need to find out more about the scripts, it seems very intersting.



 Exercise 

 With the google jam exercise, I learn how to use clojure that is a program language that I never hear about it.  I learn how to install clojure in the terminal of the mac and then how to run a line of the code in the terminal. Also I learn about queues and stack from an exercise from HackerRank, I already know about these data structures but I don’t use them a lot so is good remember about this. 

#Week3 Fancy Topics 

Test Driven Development.

I learned that TDD is a programming technique that involves the implementation of a program to test the program with the desired behavior. Tests help us keep promises regarding the quality, cost, and existence of previously installed features.  

Unit Test.

This programming technique is for test a section of the programming code to be sure that it works as expected. There are some common elemets that describe a unit test. First there are low-level and only focused on a small part of the software. Second there are commonly written by developers themselves using their regular tools and third unit tests are expected to be significantly faster than other kinds of tests. There are two kinds Solitary and Sociable and the difference is that Solitary is for test a isoleted part of the software and the Sociable is for test on other units to fulfill its behavior. 

Xunit.

I learned the beginnings of the IDE’s warnings when you start a code. There are very useful when you start writing your code and the application alerts you when you have a issue in your code before you deploy it. 

Mock aren’t stubs.

A Mock object is a special case objects that mimic real objects for testing and there are a number of mock object libraries out there. Is more easy to implement a test code with this kind of library and also the code is more understandble. 

Java build tools.

I learn that when you want to add a library to your project you need manage all the characteristics of it. And when the modularity became popular, the need for inter-project as well as external dependencies has grown, and as a result all the most commonly used build automation tools have stepped up to that challenge and have dependency management support.  
 
Vim.

Vim is a command-line editor based on the Vi editor of the Unix systems. I learn how to enter and exit the editor. It has different modes for inserting text vs manipulating text and Vim’s interface itself is a programming language: keystrokes are commands, and these commands are composable. It's a intersting text editor I never use it but now I'm going to practice in this editor.


The future of programming.

I learned about this presentation is that the technology can change fast but people will resist to the change and they need to unlearn about programming and learn about the new methods, languages and paradigms of programs. 

The best presentation of your life.

For me it's very difficult explain a subject to a group of persons but I am improving my skills to talk in a presentation in English. Some advises that I learn from the presentation is that you need make the people to think and feel about the topic’s presentation. For that you can use images to explain a topic and no text because an image can make people think. Also, you need to structure your presentation so people can understand you. 

Machine Learning. 

Is interesting how a machine can learn with the provided data.  I used TensorFlow and Sckitlearn before see the videos but is useful to review this topic. It's important to process the data that you want to use to train because with this data the algorithm search a pattern to classify the new data. Is useful have some frameworks that makes easy to train a ML model and visualize your dataset. 

Quantum computers and quantum physics.

It is impressive how quantum physics could help us in the problems of computer licenses such as security. Quantum computers even though their processor is very small, it must be in a cooled and enclosed room. 
 
Java Exercise.

This week I had to solve an exercise in Java about to made a movie recommender. This language is familiar to me because I used to design Android applications in Java and the IDE that I used was Intellij that is the same company that make Android Studio, but I had a problem with Maven because I used to see the “println” outputs in the terminal but in Maven you can’t do it. In the process of this exercise, I learned how to install the Java build tools, its dependencies how to manage them and so on. To improve the performance for the program, it was better to use Hash tables instead of lists so it was great to apply.



Week 4 It’s all about science 

Programing the universe 

I learned from that lecture is that in the nature there are systems that compute information, starting after the big bang. And with mechanical quantum computers can allow us to understand the universe. Other thing that I can't forget from the lecture is that:  

The information not always have a meaning.  

Meaning has to do with interpretation.  

 

Quantum machine learning 

In this lecture the presenter explains how the quantum computer works and the relation with Qbits vectors and ML algorithms that are vectors too and you can do those operations at quantum mechanical level. They try to do a big data analysis in intrinsically quantum mechanical ways that are potentially more efficient than the classical ways. 

Why should you have your own black box 

Talent is not enough and you should have a record for all your mistakes or right things for learning from them and with hard-work, persistent, resilience and practice you can be a good professional.  You could not have born with the enough talent but you can develop the talent with effort, discipline and consistency. 

 

Richard Feynman 

From all the lectures about Richar Feynman, I learned that he was theoretical physicist and a good professor. He was curious about everything and he got interested in mathematical and finally in physics. He was helping to calculate the magnitude of a nuclear explosion in the WW II. He is remembered as one of the greatest scientific of XX century. 

Computing a theory of everything 

This lecture is about a mathematical application named Wolfram and I used that program when I was in the university and it helped me to understand calculus, probability and statistics.  

 

Testing and automation 

Some test engineering culture at google is: 

Product Quality and testability is a collective effort. 

Strive for automated testing. 

Balance between quality and feature velocity. 

Continuous collaboration. 

Contribute to the Optimization of building, developing, testing and the release of products. 

Netflix has his culture (Freedom and Responsibility): 

Developers deploy when they want 

Also manage their own capacity and autoscaling 

And are on-call to fix anything that breaks at 3 am 

Exhaustive test (Impossible) 

Massive rapidly changing data sets 

Internet scale traffic 

Independently controlled services (Amazon)  

 

Chaos Engineering is Preventive Medicine 

Chaos Engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. It’s interesting how many companies use this technique for test their systems to avoid having a system outage. 

 

We argue that you should perform your chaos engineering experiments in the following order: 

 Known Knowns - Things you are aware of and understand 

Known Unknowns - Things you are aware of but don’t fully understand 

Unknown Knowns - Things you understand but are not aware of 

Unknown Unknowns - Things you are neither aware of nor fully understand  

 

 

The pretotyping Manifesto  

Innovators beats ideas 

Pretotypes beats prototypes 

Data beats opinions 

Doing beats talking 

Simple beats complex 

Now beats later 

Commitment beats committees 

 

For the pretotyping exercise I learned how to use Figma that is a web application to create a design of an application in this a case a mobile application. Before start a project is better to be sure if the users will use the application, so for that we create a scenario to validate the idea and see if it is viable to create the application. I make a survey for an application that warns you if you will upload sensitive information about yourself and all the results are in the document in this link. (You need to have a Encora email to see the document)
