**My first week in the third phase**

This week was interesting because we need to colloborate in a open source project. At first I didn't know what kind of porject I'd like to contribute, I was looking fior projects in Github. First I look for the Kafka repo because I choose a question related to it. And then I found another project named scikit-learn that is a python packege for machine learning, this is interesting and this repo has a lot of recent comments so is an alive project. The problem is that I don't know what kind of issue I need to choose.

Other thing I was doing is to learn about data structures in Java and python. Also what is a class and an object and all related to OOP (Object Oriented Programming). This is to be prepare for the interview at the end of the month.
