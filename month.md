**Month 1 Reset Phase**

It's been a month since the academy started and I learn a lot about how to learn, how to be more successful with your goals, how start a project and how to talk with coworker and clients about software development and social meetings. This month was difficult to me because I don’t have organization with my activities and sometimes, I don’t finish the activities on time. But the first month is for reset your mind and improve yourself. I’ve learned a lot these weeks and I’m going to do my best for getting more knowledge and experience in this area. In this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ozFSGsEU2f9IKycyAX9Be9HlHHdsHbn1/view?usp=sharing) you can see a sketch about this month. 

**Coursera Learning How to Learn**

I learn that Edison and Salvador Dali get their ideas from the focus mode and diffuse mode. They had a key or a ball bearing in one hand and when they got sleep the object felt to the floor and the clatter would wake them up, just in time so they could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in their minds, and then they go back into the focus mode bringing with him the new connections they had made while in the diffuse mode. 

When you do something that you rather not do, you activated some areas of your brain associated with the pain so automatically you change the activity, that is procrastination. For avoid this situation you can make an exercise to focused in the activity for 25 minutes and then rest some minutes and then focused on the activity again. It's a little like doing an intense 25 minutes workout at a mental gym. The practice makes you improve your skills. I have an issue with concentrating in an activity and for some reason I am not persistent in these activities to improve my concentration, but I will keep trying until I improved my skills. 

 

**Make it stick** 

What I learned about reading this book that learning is something that your parents told you when you are a child and starts going to the school, but they didn’t say much about how to learn. Learning requires memory and it’s an acquired skill. There are many common practices of learning and some of them are counterproductive and a waste of time. Also, I learned that Learning is stronger when it matters, when the activity we are doing affects us in an important way.  

Some technique that helps you to learn about yourself is the reflection on personal experience, it helps you to be more wisely. Other technique is massed studying but is faster forgetting compared to retrieval practice, when retrieval practice is spaced, allowing some forgetting to occur between tests, it leads to stronger long-term retention than when it is massed.  

Another practice is to interleave topics in your study sessions, this could help you to make associations among the topics and make it easy to remember new topics.  	 

The easier knowledge or a skill is for you to retrieve, the less your retrieval practice will benefit your retention of it.  

You can read about a new concept and then try to explain it in your own words, this helps you to understand the new topic and it's easier to remember when you associate it with prior knowledge. 

For an unsolved problem is easier to remember when you start the problem from zero than start the problem seeing a video tutorial with the solution. 

Some issue I have is the illusion of knowledge and in this book said that you could think that you understand well something but until you test it you can’t be sure about it. Once you are aware that you don’t know something as you thought you can work to solve it. 

Something that I need to remember is that our success is also determined by focus and self-discipline, which are the offspring of motivation and one’s sense of personal empowerment. Sometimes I lost the focus of my goal but I need to be more disciplined and create a strategic to learn better.			 

**Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software** 

In this book I learned that a Code is a representative language that we use to communicate with other people or machine. There is a system for transferring information between people and/or machines that can communicate to do some activity. In the history of the humanity, we made a lot of codes to communicate each other like the Morse code, Braile, flashlights, telegraphs, etc.  

For the telegraph and the code morse we need to count the signals we receive to interpreter the information they are transmitting, so we use a decimal system to count these signals. In a computer we use a binary system to encode our information in a memory. There are only two binary digits 0 and 1. This is the language of the machine; we can represent each character of our alphanumeric system in a row of 0 and 1. ASCII is a Standard for interchange information from a binary or hexadecimal form to represent a character. 

Also, the book mentions the basic function of a computer and its basic components, like memory RAM and the CPU. It’s interesting how the author explains this topic and he talk about two classic microprocessors the Intel 8080 and the Motorola 6800, but for me the processor Z80 is the processor who made the embedded systems that they are today. In this book mention the logic gates that are the principal characteristics of the microprocessor to make operations.
