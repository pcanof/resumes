**My fourth week on the third phase**

For this week I was looking for a Open Source project and the last project that I was working on doesn't work in my PC so I chose another project that it was a Javascript project with React and it take a lot of time to understand the code of the project but I found the code that is the issue and with some help of my mentors I can solved the issue and make my first PR of the month. It was exciting because I help to a project that other developers can use that program. For now the PR is awaitng a review but I think is a good code to fix the issue.
