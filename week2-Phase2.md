**Client Meeting**

In the meetinig of the clients, we introdeced the first example of the application and we got some comments about how they imagine the application and the principal feature is that the questions needs to have some kind of format, this will take us a lot of time. Also they comment about why we don't show in wich channel of slack the bot doesn't publish the question. This was resolved with a error handling and a text format. If we closed the channel id between <# >, the slack message will show the name of the channel. In the next meeting we will present the application with almost all the features of the application.
