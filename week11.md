**My second week on the third phase**

For this week I was triyng to collaborate in the project of Scikit-learn and only I did a research about the Elastic Net Regression with Linear Constraints and for more that I read it became more difficult to me to understand how to resolve this issue so at final I quit the project and search for other one. Then I try to contribuite in apache kafka project but and when finally I found a issue that I want to help, I don't be able to sing up to the webpage where you need to register and participate 

On this week I spend much time in thinking in how to collaborte in a project and I didn't make a PR in some project. For the projects that I saw, there are huge and complex and for comment about an issue or suggest a new feature it needs a lot of experience using that code of the project. So for the next week I will looking for other projects and kind of easy issues, but not about documnet the code there a lot of them in the projects that found.
