**Fourth week in Phase 4**
**In my week number 18 in encora**


For this week I learned about javascript and react. For javascript I learn about the versions of the language and some of the features of each version and ES6 is the most important because in that versiom added the support of let, const, arrow funtions, sets and maps objets, etc.
The difference between let and const is that let can be updated while const doesn't. Both has a block scoped and only can declare once.

For React I learned about DOM, Components, useState, effectState and some functions like fetch and axios (this is an external library). Also I learned about search in a hashmap in javascript for that I use forEach which is like a for in Python where this function uses each value of the object to process them and when there are no more values the loop ends.


For my interviewmania activity, I learned how to create a interview and how to guide the ienterviewer to be more comfortable in the interview. The feedback that I received about my permfomrance in the inerview as interviewee was good. I need more practice to achieve a more fluid conversation and more experience with the programming language to help the interviewer on his excercise.
