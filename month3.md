**My third month in encora**

This month I had to collaborate in a Open Source project. At first I was confused but once I agreed with the project owners about the issue of the project it was a piece of cake. At first I don't be able to collaborate for some projects because the projects was so dificult to resolve like the scikitlearn issue. In that issue I need to investigate about the Elastic Net Regression with Linear Constraints, and then I realized that the issue isn't from the project owners, this issue is from a user and the owners doesn't respond to this issue so I guess it is not in their plans to solved this issue.

Then I tried to solved an issue that another of the academy abort to solved this issue but I got stuck in the same way that she did, so I chose to look for another project and then I found netifly that is a project with javascript and React. And for some days I was able to solved the isse and made a PR for that issue. In the last week my PR was merged and my contibution is now in a project. 

In the end I was very satisfied with what I did in the month and I also learn a lot about algorithms, data structuresm, OOP, SOLID Principles and Agile methodologies.
