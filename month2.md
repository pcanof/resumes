**Resume**

This month I had to create a project from scratch with my team. At first we were all confused but once we agreed with the project functions we got to work. During the client meetings it was confusing because our clients were also our mentors and talking to them sometimes as a client or other times as a mentor was very confusing.

In this month I learned a lot about javascript and how to use data structures like lists [] and objects {}. I also learned a variety of things about environment variables, node.js dependencies and https tunnels to export my server to the internet.

In the end I was very satisfied with what we did in the project but the only thing that I am not satisfied is in the non-relational database. We use this database because is easy to implement but for the data we handled a relational database was much better for the future functions it will be more convenient. The clients don't like the final product because we ignored them, and they don't feel part of the project.
