**My third week on the third phase**

For this week I was looking for a Open Source project and one that I was interesting is a project for educators that helps to managinig peer evaluations and feedbacks of their students. I was triyng to collaborate in this Java project and I followed the steps to setup the proyect in my PC and repicate the issue but I was unable to run the project for some problem with the Java JDK. I was investigating how to solve this problem with any success. Also I was looking for more projects if I don't get to anywhre of the Java project.
