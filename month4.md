**My fourth month in encora**

This is my last month in Encora and I this phase I learned about how my behavior should be in an interview and also how can I sell myself to companies that are looking for some workers with my skills.

Also with some readings that i made in the month I learned that the best programming language for a interview is the language that is more comfortable to you. The companies are more interested in how you solve the problems that they give you. 

Some of the videos that I saw int his phase are about the stress in the work and how can I get less stressed and how this will affect my work. Also I saw some videos about interviews in google and Facebook that are like 6 to 8 interviews to get a job in those companies. And in this interviews the interviewer needs to be alert on his coding style that is using because is important when somebody needs to check your code.

I like to be in encora Academy, I learned a lot and also I saw how is the world of a programmer job. I know that I don't understand some topics taht are important in Software but I will effort to learn more and get ready when an opportunity comes to me.
