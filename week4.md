**Week 4 It’s all about science** 

**Programing the universe**

I learned from that lecture is that in the nature there are systems that compute information, starting after the big bang. And with mechanical quantum computers can allow us to understand the universe. Other thing that I can't forget from the lecture is that:  

- The information not always have a meaning.  

- Meaning has to do with interpretation.  

 

**Quantum machine learning**

In this lecture the presenter explains how the quantum computer works and the relation with Qbits vectors and ML algorithms that are vectors too and you can do those operations at quantum mechanical level. They try to do a big data analysis in intrinsically quantum mechanical ways that are potentially more efficient than the classical ways. 

**Why should you have your own black box**

Talent is not enough and you should have a record for all your mistakes or right things for learning from them and with hard-work, persistent, resilience and practice you can be a good professional.  You could not have born with the enough talent but you can develop the talent with effort, discipline and consistency. 

 

**Richard Feynman**

From all the lectures about Richar Feynman, I learned that he was theoretical physicist and a good professor. He was curious about everything and he got interested in mathematical and finally in physics. He was helping to calculate the magnitude of a nuclear explosion in the WW II. He is remembered as one of the greatest scientific of XX century. 

**Computing a theory of everything**

This lecture is about a mathematical application named Wolfram and I used that program when I was in the university and it helped me to understand calculus, probability and statistics.  

 

**Testing and automation**

Some test engineering culture at google is: 

- Product Quality and testability is a collective effort. 

- Strive for automated testing. 

- Balance between quality and feature velocity. 

- Continuous collaboration. 

- Contribute to the Optimization of building, developing, testing and the release of products. 

Netflix has his culture (Freedom and Responsibility): 

- Developers deploy when they want 

- Also manage their own capacity and autoscaling 

- And are on-call to fix anything that breaks at 3 am 

Exhaustive test (Impossible) 

- Massive rapidly changing data sets 

- Internet scale traffic 

- Independently controlled services (Amazon)  

 

**Chaos Engineering is Preventive Medicine** 

Chaos Engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. It’s interesting how many companies use this technique for test their systems to avoid having a system outage. 

 

We argue that you should perform your chaos engineering experiments in the following order: 

- Known Knowns.- Things you are aware of and understand 

- Known Unknowns.- Things you are aware of but don’t fully understand 

- Unknown Knowns.- Things you understand but are not aware of 

- Unknown Unknowns.- Things you are neither aware of nor fully understand  

 

 

**The pretotyping Manifesto** 

- Innovators beats ideas 

- Pretotypes beats prototypes 

- Data beats opinions 

- Doing beats talking 

- Simple beats complex 

- Now beats later 

- Commitment beats committees 

 

For the pretotyping exercise I learned how to use Figma that is a web application to create a design of an application in this a case a mobile application. Before start a project is better to be sure if the users will use the application, so for that we create a scenario to validate the idea and see if it is viable to create the application. I make a survey for an application that warns you if you will upload sensitive information about yourself and all the results are in the document in this link. (You need to have a Encora email to see the document)
