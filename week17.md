**Third week in Phase 4**

**In my week number 17 in encora**


For this week I learn more about interviews and how I can answer a question concisely and also I learn some techniques for getting more confidence. I need to review again all the topics that are the pillars of science computing and the basics of some lenguages. In my Interview I realized that I need to read again about processors units. In some of the questions I get confused and I said the difference between a Von Neuman and Harvard architecture intead of the difference of a 64 bits and 32 bits unit procesors. That one of the diference is that an 32 bits arquitecture only can support 4 GB of RAM. 



For the lenguages I've been doing some excercises on the web with Javascript and Python. And I realized that some algorithms are difficult to understand but when you see the mathematical functions that are behind the code is simplier to understand.
