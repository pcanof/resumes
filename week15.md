**First week in Phase 4**
**In my week number 15 in encora**


For this week I learn about interviews and how to respond to some questions, but the most important is that when you answer a question you need to be secure and don't have fear to sy "I don't know". Some times its better say I don't know instead of telling lies or some ideas that come to your mind that are probably not true.

Also I was learning about some excercises from HankerRank like trees, arrays, grahps. that help me to understand better this concepts of programming. And for the book "Cracking the coding interview", I learn that not because you know a lot of technicall skills you will get the job, it is also necessary to have a good acttitude and have the ambition to want to learn more.
